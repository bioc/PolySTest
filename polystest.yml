## Number of replicates in csv file
# needs to be the same for all conditions. For conditions with less replicates, you can add empty columns to the csv file
numreps: 3
## Number of experimental conditions (time points, cell types, treatments, ...)
numcond: 4
## Paired or unpaired design (true or false)
# e.g. a time line where the samples where taken from the same patients: paired design
paired: false
## Comparison to reference condition or all vs. all
# for full comparison: 0, otherwise number of condition according to the order in the file
refcond: 0
## first column with quantitative values
# usually 2 as the first column contains feature id (such as protein accession names)
# note: non-quantitative columns not used in the statistical tests should be placed in the front
firstquantcol: 2
## What is the order of the columns (true or false)
# replicates are either grouped (A1, B1, C1, ...) or ungrouped (A1, A2, A3 ,...),
# given that letters denote conditions and number denote replicates
rep_grouped: true
## name and path of csv file
# only one file allowed
# the to be tested features need to be given in rows, and the experimental condition (+ addtional info) in columns
csvfile: "LiverAllProteins.csv"
## delimiter of csv file
# can be "," or ";" or "|" or "tab"
delim: ","
## Decimal character
# usually either "." or ","
decimal: "."
## does the csv file have a (max. 1 row) header (true or false)?
header: true
## output file with results will be common csv-format
outfile: "polystest_res.csv"
## Number of threads
# default is 4
