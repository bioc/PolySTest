Description: Statistical tests The complexity of high-throughput mass
             spectrometry experiments often leads to low replicates numbers and 
             many missing values. We implemented a new test to simultaneously 
             consider missing values and quantitative changes, which we combined
             with well-performing statistical tests for high confidence
             detection of differentially regulated features.
