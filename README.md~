PolySTest can be run as shiny app on our server or using the docker version of the tool to avoid installation issues and computational bottlenecks..

## Shiny app

### Web service

You can use our web server http://computproteomics.bmb.sdu.dk:

http://computproteomics.bmb.sdu.dk/Apps/PolySTest

Be aware that the tool does allow only one user to run the background R calculations at a time. Therefore the app might become temporarily irresponsive. However, multiple sessions are separated and your data won't be shared between sessions or overwritten. 

### Implementation on own computer

The easiest option is to use the docker image:

`docker pull veitveit/polystest`

`docker run -t -i -p 3838:3838 veitveit/polystest`

and access the shiny app through http://localhost:3838


You can run the shiny app from the server.R or ui.R files using [Rstudio](http://rstudio.com) or run the app on a [shiny-server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/)

Be aware that you need to have all files and all necessary R libraries described in the Installation-


### Installation
Install the following R libraries in R:
`source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")`   
`biocLite(c("Mfuzz", "matrixStats", "limma", "qvalue", "shiny", "clusterProfiler", "RDAVIDWebService", "parallel", "shinyjs", "shinythemes"))`

Download the files into a folder and install the library *e1071FuzzVec*. You might need to compile the library on your computer:  
Run `R CMD INSTALL e1071FuzzVec_Installation` from the command line. You need to be in the VSClust folder. For Windows users, replace `R` by `InstallationPath/R.exe`.

### Build and use Docker image
A Dockerfile has been created on the basis of an OpenSuse distribution. Copy the repository to a folder and carry out the following command to build the images (takes a while)

`docker build -t veitveit/vsclust .`

You can run the image by

`docker run -t -i -p 3838:3838 veitveit/vsclust`

and access the server through http://localhost:3838/VSClust/

## Command line 

All operations but the gene set enrichment can be performed via command line running the R script `runVSClust.R`

### Usage

Given that you installed the *e1071FuzzVec* library, open the R script and change the relevant file names and parameters. The different operations are described in the R file. 

### Installation
The *e1071FuzzVec* library needs to be compiled and installed, see above.
